The Thieves Guild is an organized group of thieves based in Skyrim of Tamriel that provides mutual<br />
support for the criminal endeavors of its members. It is one of several joinable factions that<br />
appear in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.<br /><br />
Based in Skyrim and headquartered in The Ratway beneath the city of Riften,<br />
members of the Thieves Guild are renowned for causing trouble in the city.<br />
Members of the guild specialize in stealing objects of varying value or loaning septims.<br />
Most citizens view them unfavorably; Mjoll the Lioness has made it her duty to maintain<br />
order in Riften and pledges to dismantle the guild. Maven Black-Briar,<br />
the affluent owner of the popular Black-Briar Meadery, consorts with the guild in exchange<br />
for their aid. The guild has an uncanny luck due to certain members striking up a deal with<br />
the Daedric Prince, Nocturnal, to serve as her guardians.<br />

<td class="style60">
Little is known about when and how the Thieves Guild was founded, but it is rumored to have been<br />
 around as long as Riften has. As the Fourth Era continued, the Thieves Guild slipped further and<br />
  further into obscurity and the members and regular clients began to leave (with the exception of Maven Black-Briar).<br />
   The guild was previously believed to be completely fictional; in Oblivion, if asked about the guild,<br />
    guards would simply state that there was no such thing. However, the Thieves Guild has become well known and, in fact,<br />
     well renowned for their thievery.<br /><br />
     The guild has some close association with the Dark Brotherhood which becomes apparent in The Silence Has Been Broken,<br />
      where the player must bring an amulet given by Amaund Motierre to Delvin Mallory, a member of the Thieves Guild.<br />

When the first group of Nightingales sought guidance from Nocturnal, she accepted,<br />
 but in return the Guild would have to keep the Skeleton's Key safe in its chamber. However,<br />
  when Mercer Frey assassinated the current Guildmaster Gallus and abducted the key from its chamber,<br />
   he activated the curse causing the Guild to go to a state of decay.<br />
