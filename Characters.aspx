    Argonians or Saxhleel are a race of reptilian people native to the large and marshy province known as Black Marsh, a region of Tamriel.<br />
They can be found in smaller numbers throughout the continent, and have been featured in every one of the main games so far.<br />
Argonians are one of the few races completely unrelated to men and mer, being descended directly from the Hist.<br />
Enigmatic and intelligent, the Argonians are experts of guerrilla tactics, and their natural abilities suit their swampy homeland.<br />
They have developed immunities to diseases that have plagued many would-be explorers in the region, <br />and they are capable of easily exploring underwater locations due to their ability to breathe water. <br />
Argonians make proficient thieves, due to their superb lockpicking and sneaking skills.

</td></tr><tr><td class="style60">


Bretons are the human descendants who hail from the province of High Rock. According to the Third Pocket Guide to the Empire,<br />
they are descended from the Nedic and Aldmeri, while other sources claimed they were the mix of Atmoran and Aldmeri blood.<br />
The Altmer thought of making a new race with their own 'elder' or 'superior' blood, by mating with other races.<br />
The Bretons are sometimes called 'Manmeri' because of this.

  >The Dunmer, more commonly referred to as Dark Elves, are the dark skinned elves originally from the province of Morrowind.<br />

They are known to be strong,<br />

intelligent, and very quick, grim, aloof, and reserved, keeping to themselves as much as possible, but are said to be ill-favored by fate.<br />

They are just as distrusting and disdainful of other races as they are to other Dark Elves.<br />

The Dunmer and their national character embrace these various connotations with enthusiastic behaviors.<br />

Several Dunmer have managed to make their way in other provinces as merchants, mages, or assassins for the Dark Brotherhood.<br />

Many of the Dunmer belong to one of the seven Great Houses. They also tend to live a very long time,<br /> 
 even when compared to other races of mer.<br />

   natives of the cosmopolitan province of Cyrodiil, the Imperials are some of the most well-educated,
     wealthy and well-spoken of the races in Tamriel. 
     Imperials are also known for their discipline and training of their citizen armies.
     Because of this, the Imperials have dominated Tamriel for more than 2,000 years.</td><td>

       Khajiit are one of the ten default playable races in The Elder Scrolls. They are one of the beast races which inhabit the continent of Tamriel,<br />
        primarily their home province of Elsweyr. They are known for their natural agility, stealth, and their production of Moon Sugar,<br />
       which can be refined into skooma. They travel around selling their wares but are not usually trusted,<br />
        due to the racial prejudice of many of the races in Tamriel, 
        resulting possibly from the belief that most Khajiit are thieves. They usually talk about themselves in third person,<br />
         such as with J'zargo, and Kharjo: "J'zargo is leaving now, J'zargo bids you farewell", or "Kharjo is ready to fight now".

         Nords are a race that were led to Skyrim by Ysgramor. They are tall,<br/>
          fair-haired and pale skinned humans from Atmora who are known for their incredible resistance to cold and even magical frost.<br />
           They are enthusiastic warriors, and act as soldiers, mercenaries, merchants and blacksmiths all over Tamriel. <br />
            Eager to augment their martial skills beyond the traditional methods of Skyrim, they excel in all manner of warfare.<br />
             Above all else in Nord culture is the quest for honor and glory, and a great emphasis is placed on family values.<br />
              They thrive in the cold, reminiscent of their native Atmora, and are known as a militant people by their neighbours.<br />
               Nords are also naturally superior at sea, and have benefited from nautical trade since their first migrations across the sea from Atmora.<br />
                They captain and crew the merchant fleets of many regions, and may be found all along Tamriel's coasts.<br /> 
                 They issue a battle cry to make their enemies flee for a short time. Nords comprise the majority of the Stormcloaks.<br /></td><td>

             the City of Orcs, but are common in other locations in Tamriel.<br /></td><td>

     Bosmer, or Wood Elves, hail from the province of Valenwood (South-West part of Tamriel). Rejecting the formalities of the civilized world,<br />
      the Bosmer discarded lavish living for a life in the wilderness, among nature, the trees, and animals. In fact,<br />
       their major cities are actually located in giant walking trees that roam the forest province of Valenwood.<br />
        They decorate their bodies to resemble their forest surroundings. Because of this, many view them as barbarians.<br />
        Despite their infamy, they are known to be extremely agile and quick. Their nimbleness serves them best in any art involving thievery.<br />
          Many are well respected archers, due to their inherent mastery of the bow.<br /></td><td>
