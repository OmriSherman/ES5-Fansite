The College of Winterhold is a guild of mages centered in Skyrim.<br />
 It is a faction and location that appears in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.<br />
  It was a guild of magic-users similar to the Mages Guild of Cyrodiil and Morrowind.<br />

    Ervine serving as the Master Wizard. During the faction's main quest, Tolfdir replaces her as Master Wizard.<br /><br />

<tr><td class="style60">
The College is located in the northern section of the city of Winterhold, in northern Skyrim.<br />
 Teachers of each magical discipline reside within, offering training and various magical wares.<br /><br />
Outsiders view the college with indignation, believing its members to be the cause of the cataclysmic,<br />
 "Great Collapse," which occurred in 4E 122. The event left Winterhold in ruins,<br />
  in terms of physical destruction with the vast majority of Winterhold destroyed,<br />
   the destabilization of its government, economy and social structure and the lasting emotional<br />
    and psychological damage to Winterhold's people, who believed that the College of Winterhold<br />
     was to blame for the Great Collapse. It is believed that when this event occurred the majority<br />
      of Winterhold fell into the ocean, as said by Jarl Korir, "cities just don't fall into the ocean".<br /><br />
