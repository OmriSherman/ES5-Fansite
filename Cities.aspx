    Dawnstar is one of the major cities located in Skyrim. It is the capital of The Pale,<br />
    and serves as a garrison town along the northern coast of Skyrim. Governed by Jarl Skald the Elder,<br />
    it is a relatively small town, consisting of two rival mines, a small dock and a small number of residents.<br />
    Dawnstar is one of the colder settlements in Skyrim; along with Winterhold and Windhelm,<br />
    as it resides in perpetual snow and ice.<br /></td><td>

    Falkreath is one of the major cities located in the province of Skyrim.<br />
   Falkreath is the only major city within Falkreath Hold and thus, is home to its Jarl.<br />
    The town lies in the southwest of the province of Skyrim, near the borders of Hammerfell and Cyrodiil.<br/>
   At one period in history, Falkreath was part of Cyrodiil. Later, the town became a settlement in Skyrim.<br />
    During the Fourth Era, when the events of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim take place, the Jarl of Falkreath is Siddgeir.<br />
    It is famous for its large graveyard, in which many Nords, both combatants and non-combatants, are buried.<br /></td>

    <tr><td colspan="2"><center class="style51">Markarth</center></td></tr><tr><td class="style60">
   Markarth is one of the major cities in Skyrim. The city is located in the far west of Skyrim,in the mountains of The Reach,<br />
     west of the Karth River. As a result the city has a good natural defense, even from the skies.<br />
      Being a long distance from any other major city and with both main roads cutting through mountains,<br />
       valleys and rugged terrain, traveling to and from Markarth is one of the most treacherous trips for travelers.<br /></td>

       Morthal, said to be named after the great Atmoran hero Morihaus, lies deep in the marsh,<br />
        a foreboding area of Hjaalmarch isolated from other villages and shrouded by a constant and ominous fog.<br />
        Morthal's small population and relatively remote location have kept it distant from most major conflicts in recent years.<br />
         The citizens of Morthal appear reclusive and cautious of outsiders.<br />
          They are quite vocal about removing the town's more recent settler, a wizard by the name of Falion.<br />
           They fear he might upset the balance of their quiet and peaceful existence.<br /></td>

           <td class="style60">Riften, referred to as Rifton in earlier records, is a city situated in the southeastern corner of the Rift,<br />
            at the eastern end of Lake Honrich, with a good portion of the city actually spilling over the water atop large wooden piers.<br />
             It is the easternmost of all the cities in Skyrim.<br />
             Riften is notorious for being the home of the Thieves Guild, and residents urge travelers away from the sprawling tunnel system.<br />
              If successfully navigated, one might find the Ragged Flagon, the headquarters of the Guild. However,<br />
               that would mean crossing the dark and tight tunnels,<br />
                and avoiding those too dangerous or outcast not to warrant residency in Riften proper or membership in the Guild.</td><br /><br />

          Ruled by the current Jarl Elisif the Fair, widow of the late High King Torygg, <br />
         it is the headquarters of the Imperial Legion stationed in Skyrim. The Thalmor have an embassy hidden in the nearby mountains.<br />
          Part of the reason for this is the eminently defensible nature of Solitude itself.<br />
           Set upon a great stone arch that towers above the mouth of the Karth River,<br />
          the city is surrounded by the soaring peaks of the nearby mountains. Solitude is both a reinforced and breathtaking stronghold.<br /><br /></td>

             <tr><td class="style60">Windhelm, also known as the City of Kings, is a city located in northeastern Skyrim.<br />
             It serves as the capital of The Eastmarch Hold and is also one of the oldest cities in Skyrim,<br />
              possibly the oldest city of man on Tamriel that's still standing, dating back to the Merethic Era.<br /><br /></td>

              <tr><td class="style60" >Whiterun is the capital city of Whiterun Hold, in the province of Skyrim. Whiterun is seen as the most “pure” Nordic city in Skyrim.<br />
               In Whiterun, Nords live as they have for centuries: their lives are simple, harsh,<br/>
                and rooted in ancient traditions. Even the city’s fortifications—wooden and stone palisade walls<br />
                 and the sheer defensive advantage offered by its position on a large bluff that raises the city above the<br />
                 surrounding tundra—are archaic by contemporary standards. So while Windhelm may serve as the Stormcloaks’ center<br />
                  of operations in the Civil War, it is the culture of Whiterun that best exemplifies what it means to be a "True Nord".<br /><br /></td>
